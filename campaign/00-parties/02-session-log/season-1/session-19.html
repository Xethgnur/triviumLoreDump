Sure his stuff is secure, he heads towards his business associated he once used. He takes the party to a dank, and dark area of the city, specifically a dredged alleyway. He eventually takes the party to a door that seems well cleaned but only from the middle down, and a sign above that says "<a data-href="Haggle" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/haggle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Haggle</a>'s Goods". Antilean recalls that he can get some very volatile magically enchanted bullet rounds from this vendor, something he does not dabble in this himself. Ronpip can smell something familiar, which puts him on edge. The party enters the store, which seems mostly filled with common adventuring gear. In the back, Haggle seems to be working on a timepiece. When Antilean calls out to him, he comes to the counter and shows he has no legs to his body. Antilean tries to commission him for more bullets, but he has unfortunately ran out of the necessary resources. He sent adventurers to a particular location nearby where the crystals he needs grows naturally, but these adventurers have not returned since the weeks ago that he sent them. Ronpip recognizes that these crystals are very powerful and very volatile. Antilean agrees with Haggle to find the crystals, and potentially the adventurers he sent. Haggle provides them a local map and marks the area where they can find where they grow. The party buys a few mundane items that they believe will help them in their immediate and potential adventures.</p></div><div><p>The party set out, gathering their horses and Antilean's wagon. However, as soon as they step out of the gates, Antilean recognizes the Tabaxi caravan he used to travel with have decided to camp just outside the town. Antilean is accosted by a mix of emotions, which Vimack reads incorrectly and immediately draws his blades in preparation for something. Antilean calms him and tells him the Tabaxi are good people and there is no need for violence against them. Antilean calls out to them in his trademark greeting, and they all respond back, happily. One particularly older Tabaxi approaches and calls Antilean by his clan given name. Antilean recognizes him as the chief of this caravan of Tabaxi troop, <a data-href="Owl-in-the-Morning" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/owl-in-the-morning.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Owl-in-the-Morning</a> of the Gellicals. They make some small talk together, revealing their conflicting life philosophies between Antilean and his people. Antilean mentions that him and the party are out on a quest, being awkward about the whole interaction. Vimack points this out but <a data-href="Owl-in-the-Morning" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/owl-in-the-morning.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Owl-in-the-Morning</a> declares that Antilean was always awkward. Antilean asks about his ex-wife <a data-href="Serran" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/serran.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Serran</a> and kids, and <a data-href="Owl-in-the-Morning" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/owl-in-the-morning.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Owl-in-the-Morning</a> mentions <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Serran" data-href="Serran" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/serran.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Reedsong</a> is well, and the kids are with <a data-href="Daisy" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/daisy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Daisy</a>, which vexes Antilean and causes Vimack to get defensive for Antilean's sake. Vimack demands to know why <a data-href="Serran" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/serran.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Serran</a> left Antilean, though Antilean would rather speak on the topic another time and move on with the quest they said they would fulfill. However, Vimack asks <a data-href="Owl-in-the-Morning" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/owl-in-the-morning.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Owl-in-the-Morning</a> where she is, and <a data-href="Owl-in-the-Morning" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/owl-in-the-morning.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Owl-in-the-Morning</a>, none-the-wiser, points out her location. Vimack then proceeds to find her, despite Antilean's vocal volume quickly reaching its limit in attempts to use words to stop the Goliath on a horse. <a data-href="Owl-in-the-Morning" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/owl-in-the-morning.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Owl-in-the-Morning</a> tries to stop him from taking the horse into the camp but his passive words are made far too late. Antilean and Ronpip hop off their respective mounts and chase after Vimack. </p></div><div><p>Vimack gallops through the caravan upon his horse, following <a data-href="Owl-in-the-Morning" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/owl-in-the-morning.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Owl-in-the-Morning</a>'s directions. Eventually he finds a white haired, green eyed Norwegian Forest cat of a Tabaxi, whom he can assume is the <a data-href="Serran" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/serran.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Serran</a> that was once Antilean's ex-wife. Vimack surprises her as he arrives, hops off his horse, and aggressively approaches her. He asks if her name is Sarren, which she responds that its not a name she has heard in a long time. She seems to reach for something behind her before she spots Antilean and stops, disappointed. Vimack confirms its her, and then asks why she left Antilean.</p></div><div><p>Antilean is so exasperated by the immediate events that he jumps on to Vimack in a desperate attempt to pull him away and save face. Ronpip also hops on to Antilean, to add a little gnome to the chaos. Antilean manages to get onto Vimack's back, but the Goliath goes nowhere. Ronpip grabs Antilean by his waist, and Vimack ends up swinging both of them around in confusion. Vimack puts his concentration back on to <a data-href="Serran" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/serran.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Serran</a> and tries to convince her that Antilean is a good Tabaxi worth being with. Antilean pleads with Vimack to stop and apologizes to <a data-href="Serran" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/serran.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Serran</a>. Vimack claims that <a data-href="Serran" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/serran.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Serran</a> broke Antilean heart, but <a data-href="Serran" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/serran.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Serran</a> retorts saying that Antilean was the one who broke people's hearts. Leaving the troop, her, and their kids for his business which has clearly offended her in some way. Antilean, at this point, surrenders his soul to the gods, slumped upon the floor in defeat knowing this could have been avoided and he would not have to have these words carve a second time into his heart. Ronpip hops off Antilean, sypathetic to the situation. Vimack pulls Antilean to his feet and claims he left out a few details, but Antilean counters that he was not given a chance to explain anything and that he had originally offered a private conversation. Before Antilean can ask about the kids, <a data-href="Serran" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/serran.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Serran</a> mentions they are with <a data-href="Daisy" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/daisy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Daisy</a>, which they both know means Antilean will not be seeing them. She also returns to him some of his belongings he had left behind, though she subtly makes it apparent that he does not really deserve the courtesy. She returns a clan pancho and an amulet. </p></div><div><p>Vimack apologizes for his sudden appearance and interrogation, though <a data-href="Serran" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/serran.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Serran</a> says that other Tabaxi do the same so its no big deal. Antilean stumbles upon his words about the future between him and her, and then says its good to see her again before awkwardly shuffling away. Ronpip shuffles after Antilean; Vimack says his goodbye as well and <a data-href="Serran" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/serran.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Serran</a> asks Vimack to keep Antilean alive, at least for the kids sake. Vimack agrees, and the two part.</p></div><div><p>Antilean, sulking at the experience, bumps into a larger Tabaxi. He turns around and gives him a angry look that clearly shows he thinks he is above Antilean. Antilean recognises him as <a data-href="Billygoat-on-the-Hill" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/billygoat-on-the-hill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Billygoat-on-the-Hill</a>, who is on the line as next to be chief of the caravan. <a data-href="Billygoat-on-the-Hill" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/billygoat-on-the-hill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Billygoat-on-the-Hill</a> tells Antilean that he is not welcome.

Vimack arrives at the latter end of the conversation, and asks Antilean if <a data-href="Billygoat-on-the-Hill" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/billygoat-on-the-hill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Billygoat-on-the-Hill</a> is someone they need to worry about, but Antilean says he is just "a flat-foot with some big dreams" and nothing to worry about. </p></div><div><p>The party returns to their horses, <a data-href="Owl-in-the-Morning" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/owl-in-the-morning.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Owl-in-the-Morning</a> stroking Matilda's main and keeping her engaged while the party was away.

The party departs the caravan and heads West.</p></div><div><p>Following the map that Haggle provided, the party comes upon some very old ruins of green and white stone with themes of eyes throughout. A statue of an unknown deity sits at center of these ruins, unidentifiable. Behind him, entry deeper into the ruins, where a single dead body lies upon the ground in a position that suggests he was exiting the ruins from below. Vimack scouts the area while Antilean and Ronpip check out the dead body. The dead body appears to be a human from Amun-Ra with a cloth mask across his face. Antilean inspects the body and sees several lacerations across the body, a few broken ribs, parts of his clothes burned, and, the most apparent problem, his entire back caved in like he was crushed by something. Ronpip begins to check the man's pockets for anything of valuable, information or by coin. They find a gold pouch hat has 12 gold pieces in it, and based on his positioning, he had something in an outstretched hand but it was taken away. Antilean looks about for tracks, and he spots seven sets of foot tracks. Six of them went in, one appears to have exited from the ruins. Vimack calculates that these tracks are a couple weeks in age, two of them seem like they are uniquely fresh headed inside.</p></div><div><p>Ronpip looks into the ruins, and sees a pit of black, porous rocks sprawled across the floor, and two bodies that are charred beyond recognition lying upon it. He summons the <a data-href="Tool of War" href="campaign/11-npcs/no-affiliation/tool-of-war.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Tool of War</a> and casts <a data-href="Detect Magic" href="campaign/14-arcana/divination/detect-magic.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Detect Magic</a> around the immediate area, but no magic is detected. He begins to investigate the doorway for traps, and does not find any immediate traps. He steps into the pit of black, porous rock, which clacks about as his steps kick up a few. He proceeds forward and checks the corridor ahead for traps, but also finds nothing. Ronpip knows that this area is trapped, but does not know what yet triggers it. Vimack takes notice the bodies are facing towards the exit like they were trying to leave, and thinks the trigger for these traps are further in. Antilean is confused as to why a dungeon would be made backwards and Vimack chimes in that its not meant to keep people out but keep people in. Antilean is disgusted by this suggestion.</p></div><div><p>Further in, slits with holes cover the walls, and splatters of dried blood decorate the walls and floor. The party tries to look around for what may set off the trap behind them and the traps within the walls, but nothing in the room suggests a trigger to these traps. A set of double doors lead into the next room, which Ronpip pushes open, feeling that the doors close themselves with weight. A Stairwell with the same slits and holes along the walls present themselves passed the doors. Vimack notices that the door handles are not fully closed, and something could slot into them. He places a pot between the doors to prop them open, and prevent them from being fully closed. In the next room, there is a room with pipe holes outfitting the walls and ceiling, and the floor dips downwards. Two bodies lie at the bottom, dead, grasping at their throats with some dried foam, ooze, and blood. Ronpip examines them, and easily determines that they died from a choking poison. Vimack tries the next set of doors and find they are also weighted to self-close. Antilean is nervous and preps his mechanical cannon that follows him wherever he goes. Ronpip summons his blade as they step up to the sides of the door, unsure what's on the other side. After his friends position themselves for combat, Vimack kicks in the door. The doors swing open suddenly, and then swing back shut of their own accord.</p></div><div><p>What Vimack could witness in this short moment was a a pillared room, swathes of rainbow coloured crystals along the edges of the room, an idol at the center of the room that is crying water onto a gemmed orb, and two robed figures that were standing at the idol, who make a startled glance back. Vimack relays his findings to the party. Ronpip knocks on the door but nothing happens. Vimack gently and nicely opens the door, and the two robed figures have disappeared. </p></div><div><p>Vimack moves in first, cautious of the two figures that have suddenly disappeared but cannot see them at all. Antilean follows inside with his turret <a data-href="Dragoon" href="Dragoon" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Dragoon</a>, standing next to Vimack back to back. Ronpip activates his <a data-href="Boots of Speed" href="campaign/15-magic-items/wonderous-item/boots-of-speed.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Boots of Speed</a> and positions himself between Antilean and Vimack to cast <a data-href="Detect Magic" href="campaign/14-arcana/divination/detect-magic.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Detect Magic</a> to look out for magic. He spots two vague auras of Illusion, and points them out to the party while also taunting the two figures hidden behind the magic. Ronpip then spots that one rushes at Vimack. Seemingly out of nowhere, Green Flames strike against Vimack as he is slashed, the Green Flames leap out at Antilean as well. A second slash swipes across Vimack, and he attempts to retaliate, but feels nothing strike against his blades. Ronpip sees the other one rush at Vimack, and though the figure's first attack caught Vimack's armor, the second attack seemed to adjust and swipe into Vimack's flesh, and a sonic field envelopes him. Neither figure reappears after making the attacks.</p></div><div><p>Vimack takes notice that <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Arcane Wyvern" data-href="Arcane Wyvern" href="campaign/00-parties/01-characters/party-1/arcane-wyvern.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Dorizoul</a> has been tracking the figures, and curiously orders her to use her breathe weapon. The missiles swarm around the party before pummelling into the invisible figures, audible sounds of pain can be heard.

He strikes with a perfected maneuvers that along side his damage, he causes the revealed high elf drop his long sword, and he strikes with a follow up attack. He then zips passed him, with the figure swipes with claws and strikes a clone instead of Ronpip. As the party takes notice of their assailants and plans their next move, they notice the cut across the blinded assailant begins to close on its own, faster than what would be normal. The high elf that was prone rises, and tells his companion to make his blade sing, and he causes his blade to begin to vibrate. The blind one attacks Vimack with his claws, missing both of his attacks. The one that had his sword disarmed summons a blade of shadow, that hums unsettlingly. He takes swipes at Ronpip with this shadowed sword, one hitting a duplicate spawned from Mirror Image, and another going directly at Ronpip, who parries it to reduce the damage he takes. Vimack makes a reckless attack towards the blinded high elf,</p></div><div><div data-callout-metadata="" data-callout-fold="+" data-callout="success" class="callout is-collapsible drop-shadow"><div class="callout-title"><div class="callout-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-check"><path d="M20 6 9 17l-5-5"></path></svg></div><div class="callout-title-inner">Critical Hit!</div><div class="callout-fold"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-chevron-down"><path d="m6 9 6 6 6-6"></path></svg></div></div><div class="callout-content">
<p>One strike reaches directly into the blinded high elf, and Vimack uses it to pull him in and get a more direct hit straight into his wrist with his ice enchanted blade, disarming him from his longsword.</p>

<p>Ronpip sunders the shadow blade from the other high elf, and shatters the shadow magic blade and slices through the sword hand.</p>
</div></div></div><div><p>Ronpip then follows up with a low slash, slicing deeply into the sundered elf's leg. Ronpip leaves the space, and the elf takes a swipe with his last remaining claw. He ends up striking the last duplicate. Ronpip passes by the grappling, blinded elf but he is busy grappling elf. The elf summons a shadowed blade in his damaged hand, and begins to stab into Vimack while holding on to the grapple. The blade drives itself into Vimack's body, not cutting through it but Vimack can still feel the pain as though being stabbed. </p></div><div><p>Not knowing what left to do, the regeneration heals the sundered elf's hand and leg and he grabs at the orb sitting in the palms of the statue crying upon it in the center of the pillared room. Immediately as he grabs the orb, he calls out to his companion that they need to escape as this fight is not in their favour. He misty steps beside Vimack and makes two final attacks on him. Vimack attempts to break free from the grapple, but the elf maintains his oddly high strength, and the lightning charge from Vimack's rage only grazes him.</p></div><div><p>Antilean, witnessing his new found friend getting surrounded and beaten, draws his gun but is hesitant to hit Vimack in the chaos between the elves. A whisper on the wind catches his fur and ears. </p></div><div><p>"... promising hero... call my name... say the name..."</p></div><div><p>He reaches over to the amulet, feeling a sense of power coming from it. And he calls out, "Thunder. Thunder! THUNDER!! RAAAAAHHHH!!!"</p></div><div><p>He raises the pendant to the air, and a red lightning strikes him from the ceiling, seemingly through the earth above. His eyes glow with an empowered cyan blue, and with a heroically powered confidence, aims his <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Faraday Firearm - Big Iron" data-href="Faraday Firearm - Big Iron" href="campaign/15-magic-items/weapon/faraday-firearm-big-iron.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Big Iron</a> with precision. He fires three shots, tacticool reloads the final bullet, and fires a fourth time. The sundered elf attack Vimack takes one in the shoulder, causing him to spin into the bullet aimed for his head. The elf on Vimack's back takes the last two, the bullets coming within a hair's breadth from Vimack's neck on either side, one to the shoulder and one to the head as it reals back. Both, struck by immense damage, erupt into mist. Big Iron's barrel is red hot and smoking, and Antilean comes back to lucidity. Vimack hears a clang hitting the ground, as the orb drops to the ground. Ronpip quickly runs over an places the orb back into the statue's hand before it can do anything.</p></div><div><p>Antilean asks what just happened, and Ronpip and Vimack ask him back. Ronpip takes notice that the mist of the elves seep through the door crack. Antilean is still twitch from the events that he personally went through and has to catch his breathe. Vimack investigates the orb, which seems to match the same eye symbology throughout. Vimack looks into the orb's eye-like shape, and feels like he can be inspired with possibility. Ronpip states that if the elves wanted it, they should not have it. Vimack wants to get the crystals before they deal with the orb. He calls out to Antilean to begin work, but Ronpip wants to make sure things are safe first. Ronpip wants to dig around the crystals and not break them down, to save their legs.</p></div><div><p>Antilean requests an hour as he takes out a small suitcase of tinkering tools, and develops a quickset mason's tools to assist them in breaking out the floor beneath the growing magic crystals they wish to collect. The party begins to get to work, Antilean working the stone on the floor, Vimack takes the largest clusters to the wagon above ground, and Ronpip brings up the smaller clusters. At one point, Antilean strikes the root of a cluster of crystals and freezes, and Ronpip has a moment of Anxiety. However, luckily, nothing happens. </p></div><div><p>The party manages to collect all clusters of magic crystals together, and set it up upon Antilean's wagon, either within or tied down on top, carefully. Ronpip wants to check once again that they want the orb, and Vimack confirms they do. He tells Antilean to get a slow head start while he waits for Ronpip to return, and they will catch up with their horses. Ronpip returns to the orb of the statue. He has to take a moment to think about what he is about to do; then grabs the orb and casts <a data-href="Dimension Door" href="campaign/14-arcana/conjuration/dimension-door.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Dimension Door</a> to return to the surface. Once on the surface, he makes some distance and casts <a data-href="Shatter" href="campaign/14-arcana/evocation/shatter.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Shatter</a> upon the entrance of the ruins. Ronpip says they need to get out of here, and they take off to catch up to Antilean. They discuss the events as they unfolded to each other, trying to figure out what just happened to Antilean.</p></div><div><p>The party returns to <a data-href="Phocellis" href="campaign/05-settlements/arcaedia-dominion/phocellis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Phocellis</a>, and take the crystals directly to Haggle. They shove the orb into the <a data-href="Bag of Holding" href="campaign/15-magic-items/wonderous-item/bag-of-holding.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Bag of Holding</a> and proceed to bring the crystal clusters into the backroom of <a data-href="Haggle" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/haggle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Haggle</a>'s Goods. The party receives 1200 gold pieces for the quantity of the crystals he was given, extremely happy with what he had received. Antilean inquires about the wild magic bullets, and helping out making them to cover a time crunch. <a data-href="Haggle" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/haggle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Haggle</a> is hesitant at first, but allows it. The two begin to get to work, carefully grinding down the crystals into crafting size and creating the bullets. At some point, Antilean causes a flare of magic and <a data-href="Confusion" href="campaign/14-arcana/enchantment/confusion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Confusion</a> spawns on to him, requiring <a data-href="Haggle" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/haggle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Haggle</a> to snap him out of it before he causes more problems. Thankfully, this is the worst that happens, and the two manage to create twelve <a data-href="Wild Magic Bullets" href="campaign/15-magic-items/ammo/wild-magic-bullets.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Wild Magic Bullets</a>. </p></div><div><p>While Antilean is busy, Vimack and Ronpip take a gaze into the Orb. Ronpip tries to infer what it does or is, but he cannot recall anything related to the gods of the modern age, but potentially one much much older and forgotten, potentially related to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Evan Escence" data-href="Evan Escence" href="campaign/00-parties/01-characters/inactive/evan-escence.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Evan</a>'s encounter. Vimack returns into the store and asks if he can buy five pitons, and Haggle provides. He also asks for a pot, specifically of the iron variety, but Haggle does not have one. Ronpip asks for oil, chalk, and flour. Haggle provides the oil and chalk, but he does not have flour. Ronpip inquires about potential explosives, and Haggle says he has <a data-href="Alchemist's Fire" href="campaign/15-magic-items/potion/alchemist's-fire.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Alchemist's Fire</a>, a volatile, throwable substance in a bottle that self ignites once it is exposed to the air. Ronpip purchases one bottle. </p></div><div><p>The party finishes things up and returns to the inn that <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Leeland Essence" data-href="Leeland Essence" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/leeland-essence.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Leeland</a> is staying at, the Whaling Ale. The party takes a long rest at the inn with rooms provided by Leeland, and Vimack, in the middle of the night, decides to visit Leeland's room. He sneaks to the room in the dark very quietly. Leeland is seen in the bed, rolls over and asks what he is doing, and he delivers a single gold piece in recompense before slinking off back to bed.</p></div><div><p>The party heads back to the capital with Leeland in hand, and no problematic encounters. They can see that the outer town has been evacuated and militia has moved in to set up defenses. They are stopped by guards initially, asking for their purpose for entering the city, and Vimack proudly exclaims they are friends to the Emperor <a data-href="Evan Escence" href="campaign/00-parties/01-characters/inactive/evan-escence.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Evan Escence</a>. At first the guards are questioning, but Leeland's appearance reassures them they speak the truth. The party takes notice that the capital's militia is setting up several anti-siege structures. Wood elves and Tree Ents are also preparing as part of the vanguard to the defense. Ronpip is skeptical about the wood elven warriors, but the wood elves that came to the defense seem to have the confidence of trained, veteran warriors. Leeland is perturbed by the chaos. Leeland rushes off to deliver the flowers to his mother, and the party follows. Antilean meets <a data-href="Paul McCoy" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/paul-mccoy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Paul McCoy</a> for the first time, and Leeland departs the party.</p></div><div><p>They head up from the Essence Estate to the <a data-href="Pillars of Archons" href="campaign/08-points-of-interests/castle/pillars-of-archons.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Pillars of Archons</a> to try and find Emperor <a data-href="Evan Escence" href="campaign/00-parties/01-characters/inactive/evan-escence.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Evan Escence</a>, at the escort of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Paul McCoy" data-href="Paul McCoy" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/paul-mccoy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Paul</a> . Upon getting there, Evan spots the party, wearing regal attire but donning armor against his will, Duan insisting it is for protection. He produces wings and takes off towards the party within the throne room. Vimack spills the story to Evan, and Ronpip quickly tells him to keep it down. Evan flies to Duan and asks private chamber. Evan leads them to a private chamber, and Vimack continues to spill the story of recent events, recounting the events in <a data-href="Phocellis" href="campaign/05-settlements/arcaedia-dominion/phocellis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Phocellis</a> and introducing Antilean. Antilean decides to demonstrate his dexterity with his invention, the gun, and shows off the handling of the tool. Vimack and Ronpip finish recounting the events, how <a data-href="Lorellai" href="campaign/00-parties/01-characters/inactive/lorellai.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Lorellai</a> left the group and returned home, and how they ventured into a backwards dungeon and fought against some high elves, again. They present the Orb to Evan, and although he does not recognize it directly, he does feel it has a connection to the kind of beings that <a data-href="Fidchelle the Aspect of Lore" href="campaign/02-deities/fidchelle-the-aspect-of-lore.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Fidchelle the Aspect of Lore</a> was. He summons <a data-href="My Immortal" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/my-immortal.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">My Immortal</a>, and begins to cast <a data-href="Identify" href="campaign/14-arcana/divination/identify.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Identify</a>. She tells him that it is an ancien artifact in creation of <a data-href="Innis the Aspect of Ambition" href="campaign/02-deities/innis-the-aspect-of-ambition.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Innis the Aspect of Ambition</a>, and that the orb is the <a data-href="Solitaire of Inspiration" href="campaign/15-magic-items/wonderous-item/solitaire-of-inspiration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Solitaire of Inspiration</a>. Vimack brings up that that the elves tried to take it, but they managed to stop them, although they were not able to kill them. Based on the tales of the party, his own knowledge of cryptid things of mystery, and the recent reports of increased creatures of the night haunting the nearby countryside, Evan does not believe that the party killed the elves that they encountered. Evan is concerned that they may be dealing with more undead high elves, or ones that continued the practice of Necromancy. Evan wants the party to provide the information to <a data-href="Duan Ping" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/duan-ping.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Duan Ping</a>, as recent scout reports have either been scarce, or dead.</p></div><div><p>Evan recounts the reinforcements that came from the Summerset Forest to help with the defense. <a data-href="General Orthorion" href="campaign/11-npcs/samhradh-feywilds/general-orthorion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">General Orthorion</a> has came to the aid, revealing to Evan that he is an Arcane Archer. Legions of highly skilled archers, blademen, spearmen, Ursin Warriors, and Tree Ents have arrived from the elven reinforcements. And Evan and <a data-href="Duan Ping" href="campaign/11-npcs/arcaedia/duan-ping.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Duan Ping</a> have scrambled together the militia of the capital, and several mages to remain at the backend defense. The <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Judge of Arcaedia" data-href="Judge of Arcaedia" href="campaign/10-groups/arcaedia/judge-of-arcaedia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Judges</a> have declared they will stay within the walls and protect the citizenry and the Emperor, but they will not participate in the vanguard. They also prevent Evan from bring on the frontlines, which bothers Evan as he wishes to fight alongside his friends once more, but even the party convinces him to remain at <a data-href="Pillars of Archons" href="campaign/08-points-of-interests/castle/pillars-of-archons.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Pillars of Archons</a> for his own safety. </p></div><div><p>The party discusses their next set of plans, but then they express to Evan that he needs to buy some paintings, specifically from a tiefling with a hooked hand. </p></div><div><p>During their time waiting for the attack and preparing defences as they desire, Antilean requests some raw materials, and begins to experiment in creating a new firearm. He runs out of time creating a coach gun, but manages to set up a simple rifle and a secondary simple pistol. He also sets up blueprints and engineering plans for sniping towers to assist in the defense in the town along the northern wall</p></div><div><p>Ronpip obtains a set of additional armor pieces to complete his half plate armor set, with the inclusion of the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Adamantine Armor" data-href="Adamantine Armor" href="campaign/15-magic-items/armor/adamantine-armor.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Adamantine Breastplate</a>. He also helps provide additional gnome trigonometry to make sure the trebuchets have their accuracy and efficiency maximized. At the end of the downtime, Ronpip educates some engineers and takes some scouts to trap the edge of the woods, knowing that is where the elven army will be coming. He leaves a marked trail in gnomish to ensure the scouts he took with him could come back without setting them off.</p></div><div><p>Vimack stay with the citizenry and keeps their moral high during this time of chaos, keeping them from rebelling against forced evacuation from their homes and the potential dangers coming for them. He joins a group of scouts who intend to obtain information on strength and numbers of the elven army, potentially giving them an advantage in knowing how soon they come and how strong they are. The group and Vimack manage to find the army encampment, almost running directly into them as they are camping directly in the woods, as well as using magical fog to obscure their position. Vimack takes note, lying still in a strategic position. A majority of what Vimack can assume is vanguard is unarmoured, unarmed, and undead. The others among the army appear to be High Elven soldiers with Long Swords, Long Bows, and Spears. The other half of the army are composed of cultists similar to the ones encountered at House Paramoure, accompanied with war dogs. They have a set of unique trebuchets unique to the High Elven engineering, prepared for a siege. Vimack and his group have been carefully gleaning this information over the course of days, keeping hidden and still to the best of their abilities. On the final day, before the armies continued their travel, Vimack quickly takes out 11 of those siege weapons before the alarm was raised and he and the scouts had to escape. They return to the city, and relay the information they've acquired, as well as the successful sabotage of the siege weaponry, despite it not being 100%.</p></div><div><p>3 weeks have passed from the time they've returned from Phocelles. It has been quiet and tense for a few more days, before the snow falls from the darkened sky and a war horn from the North, as a elven army struts forward towards their direction.</p></div><div><p>And the siege upon the Northern Wall of <a data-href="Vasaaros" href="campaign/05-settlements/arcaedia-dominion/vasaaros.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Vasaaros</a> happens in <a data-href="Session 20" href="campaign/00-parties/02-session-log/season-1/session-20.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Session 20</a>... </p></div><div class="mod-footer"></div></div></div></div><div class="sidebar-right sidebar"><div class="sidebar-handle"></div><div class="sidebar-topbar"><div class="topbar-content"></div><div class="clickable-icon sidebar-collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="3" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon"><path d="M21 3H3C1.89543 3 1 3.89543 1 5V19C1 20.1046 1.89543 21 3 21H21C22.1046 21 23 20.1046 23 19V5C23 3.89543 22.1046 3 21 3Z"></path><path d="M10 4V20"></path><path d="M4 7H7"></path><path d="M4 10H7"></path><path d="M4 13H7"></path></svg></div></div><div class="sidebar-content"><div class="graph-view-wrapper"><div class="sidebar-section-header">Interactive Graph</div><div class="graph-view-placeholder">
